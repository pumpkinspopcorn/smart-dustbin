# smart-dustbin using arduino-uno (internet of things)

Code has been attached. Please download arduino IDE on your respective desktop and copy the code into it. The link is attached right below:

## Components needed:
* Arduino UNO chip

* A battery not more than 12V

* An ultrasonic sensor

* A hollow dustbin
* A servo motor

* A cardboard
* Connecting wires: For making a smart dustbin, we need 3 types of connecting wires. The first one is male to male, the second one is male to female and the third one is female to female wires.
  Each wire has a different color code which is really important because each color code signifies something.
* A glue gun

## Playing Arduino UNO with the connecting wires

As described above, all the 3 different color wires should be connected the way shown in the diagram below. And ofc, connect your Ardunio to your PC and check if it works. After the battery is connected to Arduino UNO micro-chip, the chip starts blinking which indicates that the connections are made right and as soon as we keep an object near the ultrasonic sensor, the dustbin opens automatically. AYE, YOU MADE A SMART BIN.

## Suggestions to try

You could even use raspberry pi if you would like to, but I preferred Arduino chip since its way cheaper to buy.
